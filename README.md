# Image-Based-Recipe-Suggestion-Engine
Image based recipe search tool that uses an Image of ingredients to fetch top 3 relevant recipes for them from a local Database using NLP and Computer Vision.

The internet has changed the way prepare and enjoy our food. Any query for a specific dish returns hundreds if not thousands of results. However, sometimes all we need is the answer to a simple question. “I have these ingredients, what can I make”? While there exists certain tools which can suggest recipes based on the ingredients, they are mostly text-based and often fail to offer an intuitive experience. In this project, we developed an image-based search tool where we can just take a picture of the ingredients we have and get recipes that we can make using them.
